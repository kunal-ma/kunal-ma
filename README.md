## Hi there 👋🏼

My name is Kunal M.A., and I’m a **Full Stack Developer** from Ahmedabad, India. I have experience working with a variety of languages and frameworks, and I enjoy building projects that address real-world gaps, especially those I’ve experienced firsthand. Most of my professional work centers around:

- 🌐 Full-stack web applications built with modern frameworks
- 🛠️ Scalable backend services, REST APIs, and system design
- 🧩 Native Android application development using Kotlin
- 🚀 CI/CD pipelines & deployment workflows using GitHub Actions
